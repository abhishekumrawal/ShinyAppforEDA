========================================================

# 1. Introduction

As a course project for the Developing Data Products course of the Data Science Specialization offered by Bloomberg School of Public Health of the Johns Hopkins University through Coursera, I have created a *Shiny App to perform Exploratory Data Analysis*. 

## 1.1. How the evaluator should reach to this Shiny App?

I have deployed this App by means of creating a GitHub Repository named as *ShinyApp* under my username *abhishekumrawal*. Everything including this documentation is shared there. The evaluator has to *simply type and run the following command on the RStudio console*:

                    runGitHub( "ShinyApp", "abhishekumrawal")






# 2. What is Mean Total Number of Steps taken per day?

## 2.1 Plotting the Histogram

## 2.2 Calculating Mean and Median of the Number of Steps


**Conclusion:** The activity patterns are observed to be different between Weekdays and Weekends. Weekend activity patterns are relatively more volatile (random) as compared to Weekday activity patterns.
